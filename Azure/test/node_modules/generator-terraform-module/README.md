# Generator: Terraform Module

## Requirements

In order to run this generator, you will need the following:

* an up-to-date installation of [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html)
* an up-to-date version of this generator

## Installation

* install Yeoman
* install this generator

To [install Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/learning/), run the following command in your console:

```
npm install -g yo bower grunt-cli
```

This will make Yeoman (via `yo`) as well as the base dependencies of Yeoman, namely [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) available.

Note that you might require `sudo` permissions to install the above modules _globally_.

To install this generator, run the following command in your console:

```
npm install -g generator-terraform-module
```

Alternatively, you can install the generator directly from Git `HEAD` by running the following command:

```
npm install -g https://bitbucket.org/cultivatedops/generator-terraform-module/get/HEAD.tar.gz
```

### Usage

In order to run the included generator, open a console (`Terminal.app`, `PuTTY`) and change into the directory you want to generate the module in. Then, run the following command:

```
yo terraform-module
```

Should the above command fail, verify that Yeoman does indeed _see_ the generator by executing `yo` and looking for an entry named _"Terraform Module"_.

On an initial run, you will be asked to provide your full name and email address. These values will be stored for future use.

After all questions have been answered, Yeoman will generate the scaffolding needed to kickstart a Terraform module.

The layout for a generated module will look like so:

```
.
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── .release.json
├── README.md
├── main.tf
├── output.tf
└── variables.tf
```

The `.release.json` file is optional and will only be created when [Release It!](https://github.com/webpro/release-it) support is enabled during the generation.

The files will be placed in a directory containing the name you provided for the module, prefixed by `terraform-module-`.

### Demo

The following animation shows how the generator looks like, in action:
